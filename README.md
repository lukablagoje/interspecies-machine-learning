# Interspecies machine learning
Due to potential problems of obtaining human neuronal data, can animal training be used for the purpose of training the classifiers of human neurons?

# Project overview
1. Introduction and data cleaning
2. Data exploration and PCA
3. Assesing validity of classes with clustering 
4. Training classifiers on animal data
5. Evaluating the performance of classifiers on human data
# Files
If you are interested in the overall idea:
- There is a pdf presentation that explains the overall ideas

If you are interested in code:
- There is a detailed Jupyter notebook with the commented code

If you are interested in data:
- There are 4 dataframe files: "human_neurons", "monkey_neurons", "mouse_neurons", "rat_neurons" 


This is a project done in the first year course at the Department of Network and Data Science at Central European University.
