# Interspecies machine learning
Due to potential problems of obtaining human neuronal data, can animal training be used for the purpose of training the classifiers of human neurons?

## Project overview
This is a project done in the first year course "Data Mining and Big Data Analytics" at the Department of Network and Data Science at Central European University.

Sections:
1. Introduction and data cleaning
2. Data exploration and PCA
3. Assesing validity of classes with clustering 
4. Training classifiers on animal data
5. Evaluating the performance of classifiers on human data
## Files
- Pdf presentation that explains the overall ideas
