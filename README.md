## Project overview
This is a project done in the first year course "Data Mining and Big Data Analytics" at the Department of Network and Data Science at Central European University.

Sections:
1. Introduction and data cleaning
2. Data exploration and PCA
3. Assesing validity of classes with clustering 
4. Training classifiers on animal data
5. Evaluating the performance of classifiers on human data
